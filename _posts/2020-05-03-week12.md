## Write your comments about Tom Callaway's blog post.
Tom's blog post was informative. His bias regarding Red Hat aside, Tom helpfully lists some of the many business models present in the open source software industry. In particular, he states that a majority of companies rely on the open core model, a model focused on the monetization of commercially-produced open-source software. It is often implemented by inticing customers with "free" versions of software that have very limited practical functions. In order to access the rest of those practical functions, customers would have to pay for them. In order to sustain such a model, companies would have to impose limits on the usefulness of the software, forcing customers to continuously pay for upgrades. Tom seems cautiously optimistic regarding his belief that companies might do away with open core practices.

###  Brave New World

  Truth be told, I thought the coronavirus would vanish faster than Australia's ecosystems. Unfortunately, possessing the tenacity of a [tardigrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade) and the undying evvy of terrorists everywhere, it seems as though the virus will stick around for a while.
  The virus has distrupted normal city functions. Many department stores and restaurants are closed or operating under reduced hours. Travel is so scarce that train cars actually have a decent amount of seating room during rush hour. The lines at supermarkets are ridiculously long. It has gotten to the point where employees have to limit the amount of customers entering at a time. 

The most troublesome aspect of this shutdown is the implementation of tests. For the record, I receive extended time in a seperate as per my registration with Hunter's AccessABILITY office. Because schools have been closed, I now have to scramble to schedule tests such that the professors have enough time to submit them to the AccessABILITY testing department and that said department can provide me wuth a suitable amount of time to complete them.

## Recap

It has been roughly a month since the coronavirus invaded our lives. Most local and national restaurants are closed. For the few that are open, 
the concept of dining in is effectively ancient history. Old skill sets are becoming relevant again. Thanks to the immense backlog in unemployment claims, 
COBOL programmers are in high demand because a majority of business systems (i.e. ATMs, banks) rely on the language 
to function. Also, sewing is becoming increasingly popular as a result of dwindling medical supplies. 

Still, bodies are piling up faster than they can be disposed. People are still violating social distancing guidelines, 
some hosting parties with over 1,000 guests in attendance. Cell towers are being burned and masks are being microwaved in the name of killing the coronavirus. Homeless people still occupy trains. Criminal organizations are exploiting the pandemic while gun violence persists in various states. Also, Kim Jong-un might be missing in action. Make of that what you will. 

In short, it has been a hectic month.

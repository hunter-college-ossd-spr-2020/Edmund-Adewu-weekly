## Gatsby Status
I managed to make a [pull request](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/24089). After navigating the moderately recursive starter sections of the website, I installed the mandatory dependencies for site development.
The starter subsection only lists the following 3 starters: 
* [Blog](https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.app)
* [Default](https://gatsby-starter-default-demo.netlify.app)
* [Hello World](https://gatsby-starter-hello-world-demo.netlify.app)

The [official site](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/starters/#official-starters) lists 5. The [workspace theme](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-theme-workspace) is of a minimalist nature not unlike the aforementioned Hello World example, with the text being the only difference. The [blog theme](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme) contains a plugin which allows the user to adjust the background lighting at will. After altering the necessary files and saving those changes, I made the pull request. I will follow up with other maintainers to ensure that the changes are accepted.

## Recap
This week, the class listened to Gil Yehuda discuss the complexities and evolution of open source software along with how to obtain employment related to open source project management.
## Gil Yehuda
The components of the discussion that I found most useful were the advice on applying for jobs and imposter syndrome. Regarding employment, some employer listings and websites might be rather vague on the specific skills desired and how they go about realizing their motives and goals. Even if they aren't, job seekers may need concrete examples of how to polish up on the necessary skills in an efficient manner. Viewing the open source projects of a company specifies not only the skills required (i.e. languages, etc), but also the nature of the company.
## Open Source Contributions
After navigating the introductory pages, I made a contribution to Wikipedia. To be specific, I added to the Car Bomb page an incident where an ambulance was converted into a vehicle-born IED by terrorists and deployed in Kabul.
